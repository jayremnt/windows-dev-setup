# Windows Dev Setup

This repository contains a PowerShell script (`setup.ps1`) designed to automate the installation and configuration of
some software, tools, and CLIs on my new Windows.

## Installation

Open **PowerShell** with _**administrative privileges**_ and execute:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jayremnt/windows-dev-setup/master/setup.ps1" -UseBasicParsing | Invoke-Expression
```

## What's inside?

Alright, that's all for now. I'm feeling a bit lazy to add more of what I currently use. Maybe I'll update the script in
the future. XD
